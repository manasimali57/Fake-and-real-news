# Fake-and-real-news
This project aims to classify news articles as either fake or real using a machine learning model. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between fake and real news articles.

Project Overview
This project involves:

Data Preprocessing: Loading and exploring the fake and real news datasets using Pandas.
Feature Extraction: Converting text data into numerical features using TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn.
Model Training: Training a Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) to classify news articles.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.
The model achieves an accuracy of 99.33% on the test set, as shown in the evaluation metrics.
